Technical information:​

    The language used in the development of this product is C
    Virtually no high-level WINAPI is used
    The product is on the most powerful servers with anti-DDoS protection.
    All decryption is completely server-based, all data transmitted by the stealer is decrypted on the server.
    In order to increase chunking, data is sent in chunks.
    The weight of the build is 150-300KB, CRT is present but not used, on request if you care about weight, link CRT from another studio, the weight will decrease in the process, UPX will compress the build to 80KB, but it is not recommended to do this procedure
    A neighbor detection system is available, as well as a traffic quality monitoring system
    System calls support ARM, x86, x64 architectures
    Stealer works on operating system versions from Windows 7 x32 to Windows 11 x64 with the latest updates.
    There is a knock in Telegram bot / channel, both about the arrival of the log, and the log itself
    All interaction with the OS is done through calls to a low-level wrapper written in ASM over system calls, no WinAPI only manual syscall calls (corporate rate).
    Where WinAPI is used - its calls are encrypted (read custom GetProcAddress)
    Implemented Heavens Gate technology allowing to switch from WoW64 mode (corporate tariff)
    Spreading without crypt protection
    DomainDetect is included in the log format
    Build is covered by default by our binary morpher with Control flow.
    Non-residential Loader
    Google unlogins bypass implemented (90-95% validity)
    CC collection is implemented
    Gasket rotation is implemented, 1+10 addresses are sewn into the build (instead of 1+1 main and backup addresses before), it increases survivability and stability of the build many times.

Loader

    HavensGate. The stuffing of our corporate tariff - in other words, bypassing proactive defenses.
    In the [Corporate] tariff, an additional GoogleAccounts folder is added to the log, which contains special cookies that will not crash a session even if the account owner changes the password. Sessions from the GoogleAccounts folder in the log are valid even when the main cookies are invalid, this option increases the validity of Google accounts to unprecedented levels.
