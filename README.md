# Overview

This repo will hold analysis I have performed myself, as well as collections of notes/references to interesting topics.

Anything that is my own will be uploaded directly in PDF format.

# Analysis

This repo contains analysis I have written on malware samples obtained from the internet.

No samples are provided here for download, although defanged links to the samples may be provided in papers.

Papers presented here may not be frequently updated, the environment changes quickly and IoC's/samples may quickly go out of date or be added to. I would always encourage deep research into a sample or threat to get the best understanding.

Please do not attempt to replicate anything discussed in papers posted here unless you fully understand your actions.

Please do not attempt to download, execute or otherwise manipulate any samples obtained from the internet without having a proper environment set up to do so.
